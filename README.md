- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
REST APIs were originally designed to be stateless, yet we added sessions, cookies, and JWTs to make them stateful again. 

Aside from writing, here’s something I built:

* https://aucs.net/
A modern web-based UI to manage Kong Gateway configuration

* https://restapi.design/
Ultimate reference guide for REST API design

* https://q2q.org/
A simple web-based API Explorer that lets you send GET requests and view status codes, headers, and formatted JSON responses

A developer documentation portal for AppSec+
